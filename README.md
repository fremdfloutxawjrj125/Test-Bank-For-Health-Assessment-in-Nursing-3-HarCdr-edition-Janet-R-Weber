      * This comprehensive assessment text is designed as a learning system, with a modular format that allows personal customization and ease of use. Unit One provides a complete "Overview of nursing". Unit Two, which covers "Nursing Assessment of the Adult and Older Adult", includes a chapter on general impressions and 14 body system chapters. Each of these is divided into three distinctive parts: structures and functions; nursing assessment; and analysis of data (this explains the second step of the nursing process in relation to particular data collected during assessment). The third and final unit, "Nursing Assessment of Special Groups", includes chapters on infants and children, childbearing women, the family and the community. A nursing history section uses a 2-column question/rationale format to explain why each question is asked. A physical assessment section uses a 3-column format for assessment techniques, including procedure, normal findings and abnormal findings
